# diffusion
Code and data used in the paper "Collective patterns of diffusion are shaped by individual inertia and trend-seeking"


INSTRUCTIONS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:


The code for the simulation is written in MATLAB, using version 2019B and requires no add-ons. All the functions needed are included in the corresponding folders. Hence, to run the code it is sufficient to open the corresponding folder with MATLAB.

The code for the classification is written in Excel, using Office 2016 and requires no add-ons. 

Both MATLAB and Excel code has been tested on a PC with 16GB RAM and CPU 1.9 GHz with OS Windows 10 (64-bit). Maximum run time is approximately 12 hours for the parametrisation and Monte Carlo simulation code


ORGANIZATION:

Each folder named "Fig#" contains all the code used to generate Figure # in the paper. Figure % (or the panel * of figure %) can be generated by running the file "fig#.m" or "fig%_a.m"

The folder "parameter_estimation" contains the code to perform the parameter estimation. The file "SD_estimator_16trials.m" performs the parameter estimation used in the main article, the file "SD_estimator_20trials.m" performs the parameter estimation used in the Supplementary Information as a robustness check. 

The folder "data_split_for_trial" contains 20 .xlsx files with the experimental data split for each on of the 20 trials.

The file "data.xlsx" contains the raw experimental data, its pre-processing, and the classification rule to determine explorers and non-explorers

The file "raw_data_figures.zip" contains all the .tex files used to generate the figures in the paper

The file "summary_data.pdf" contains a summary of the experimental data


DEMO

The folder "Demo" contains a sample simulation animation and the script used to generate it. To run it, it is sufficient to open the folder with MATLAB and run "plot_graph_dynamics_example.m". The run tume is of few second on a standard PC.
